# isomorphic-react-flux-example
This is something (or will be something soon) I searched for but could not find online in our own learning of react. Cheers.

**CURRENTLY NOT ISOMORPHIC, coming soon.

To use start with:

```
$ npm install --global babel-cli

$ npm install --global gulp-cli

$ git clone https://github.com/metastudiosinc/isomorphic-react-flux-example.git

$ cd isomorphic-react-flux-example

$ npm install

$ gulp

$ npm start
```
